Nike Clothing Wesbite

I am creating a website page for Nike Clothes. it is a website for customers to view and purchase items from the Nike Store and also for the company to showcase their Clothings , Assessories and Prices to their customers. The Website im creating consist of clothings for the men section which includes pictures of the clothing, prices and also button for each section for users to click on , allowing easier access to the website.

Design Process:

I Designed the website using mainly white and navy blue to create a simplistic vibe , keeping the design simple but also not tacky. The Website is for customers/ any users who is interested in purchasing clothings from Nike. The aim of this website is to showcase products to the public in a simple glance, showing the looks of it worn on models and also the price of the item itself. allowing customers to be able to imagine themselves having it on.

As a customer, i want to be able to easily view and purchase products from the website

As a customer, i want to be able to search products according to the clothing type, colour and sizes.
